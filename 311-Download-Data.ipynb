Due to the size of the dataset, my analysis was limited to 2017 and 2018 available images.  The csv has links to about 164,000 images from this time period. \n",

This is done in batches because the process is slow and I wanted to be able to restart it easily without losing much data if it held up.  It took a couple of days of running to get all 164,000 images.  \n",
